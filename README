The openQA framework consists of two parts, which are tracked in separate git
repos. The OS-autoinst test engine and the front-end with web-interface,
test-scheduler and other high-level logic, which is part of this repo.

see devel:openQA/openQA on how to setup the software on openSUSE

openQA requires os-autoinst to be installed in /usr/lib/os-autoinst
(you can bind mount/symlink the git dir there)

openQA main files must be in /usr/share/openqa (again, can be bind
mounted/linked to git).

/var/cache/openqa/ must be owned by root and contain several sub
directories owned by 'geekotest':

backlog
factory/iso
perl/ (subdirectory autoinst must link to /usr/lib/os-autoinst)
pool/1 (add more for each worker)
testresults
schedule.d
tools (symlink to /usr/share/openqa/tools/)

By default everything expects the openqa web stuff to run on
localhost. Please configure your apache accordingly (see config
files in etc/apache2).

To start the worker either use the provided systemd files (systemctl
start openqa-worker.target will start as many workers as you have
pool directories) or run tools/worker --instance X manually.

Place iso images you want to test in /var/cache/openqa/factory/iso/
Then run
/usr/share/openqa/tools/rpc.pl --host localhost iso_new FILE.ISO

Watch your workers (hopefully) picking up the jobs!
