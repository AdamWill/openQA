The openQA framework consists of two parts, which are tracked in separate git
repos. The OS-autoinst test engine and the front-end with web-interface,
test-scheduler and other high-level logic, which is part of this repo.

see devel:openQA/openQA on how to setup the software on openSUSE or run
tools/setup.sh for some help

openQA requires os-autoinst to be installed in /usr/lib/os-autoinst
(you can bind mount/symlink the git dir there)

openQA web files (www/*) must be in /usr/share/openqa (again, can be bind
mounted/linked to git checkout).

/var/lib/openqa/ must be owned by root and contain several sub
directories owned by 'geekotest':

backlog
factory/iso
perl/ (subdirectory autoinst must link to /usr/lib/os-autoinst)
pool/1 (add more for each worker)
testresults
tools (symlink to /usr/share/openqa/tools/)

/var/lib/openqa/db contains the sqlite database and must be owned by the web
user. You need to run tools/initdb to create it.

By default everything expects the openqa web stuff to run on
localhost. Please configure your apache accordingly (see config
files in etc/apache2).
You need to enable the rewrite module (a2enmod rewrite)

To start the worker either use the provided systemd files (systemctl
start openqa-worker.target will start as many workers as you have
pool directories) or run tools/worker --instance X manually.
If you did not install os-autoinst from packages make sure to pass --isotovideo
to point to the checkout dir of isotovideo, not /usr/lib! It won't find the
perl modules then.

Place iso images you want to test in /var/lib/openqa/factory/iso/
Then run
/usr/share/openqa/tools/rpc.pl --host localhost iso_new FILE.ISO

Watch your workers (hopefully) picking up the jobs!
