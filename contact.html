    <p>
    OpenQA was originally developed by Bernhard M. Wiedemann
    &lt;bernhard+osautoinst ät lsmod de&gt; with contributions from Dominik
    Heidler &lt;dheidler ät suse de&gt;. Both are still very active and
    prominent members of the OpenQA community, but the development effort is
    nowadays shared with many other hands coordinated by means of a
    <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">project in the
    openSUSE's project management tool</a>. That's the best place to take a look
    at the roadmap and the development progress, as well as the best place to
    report bugs or reach the developers in general.
