Using Snapshots to speed up development of tests
================================================

Sometimes it's annoying to run the full installation to adjust some
test. It would be nice to have the VM jump to a certain point. There
is an undocumented feature that allows to start from a snapshot that
might help in that situation:

set MAKETESTSNAPSHOTS=1 on a testsuite, resp file a job with that
setting. This will make openQA save a snapshot for every test run.

run the worker with --no-cleanup parameter

after the ended copy the disk image
/var/lib/openqa/pool/$workerid/raid/1 to
/var/lib/openqa/factory/hdd/something.img

set SKIPTO=$stage and HDD_1=something.img on the testsuite and
create a new job with those settings.

$stage is the name of the test you want to skip to. use qemu-img
snapshot -l something.img to find out what snapshots are there.
