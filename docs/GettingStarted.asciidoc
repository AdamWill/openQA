Introduction
------------
[id="intro"]

OpenQA is an automated test tool that makes possible to test the whole
installation process of an operating system. It uses virtual machines to
reproduce the process, checking the output (both serial console and
screen) in every step and sending the necessary keystrokes and commands to
proceed to the next. OpenQA can check whether the system can be installed,
whether it works properly in `live' mode, whether applications work
or whether the system responds as expected to different installation options and
commands.

Even more important, OpenQA can run several combinations of tests for every
revision of the operating system, reporting the errors detected for each
combination of hardware configuration, installation options and variant of the
operating system.

OpenQA is free software released under the
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html[GPLv2 license]. The source code and
documentation are hosted in the https://github.com/os-autoinst[os-autoinst
organization on GitHub].

This document describes the general operation and usage of OpenQA. The main goal
is to provide a general overview of the tool, with all the information needed to
become a happy user. More advanced topics like installation, administration or
development of new tests are covered by further documents available at the
https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA[official repository].

Basic concepts
--------------
[id="concepts"]

Jobs
~~~~

One of the most important features of OpenQA is that it can be used to test
several combinations of actions and configurations. For every one of those
combinations, the system creates a virtual machine, performs certain steps and
returns an overall result. Every one of those execution is called a 'job'. Every
job is labeled a numeric identifier and has several associated 'settings' that
will drive its behavior.

A job goes through several states:

* *scheduled* Initial state for recently created jobs. Queued for future
  execution.
* *running* In progress.
* *cancelled* The job was explicitly canceled by the user or was replaced by a
  clone (see below).
* *waiting* The job is in `interactive mode' (see below) and waiting for input.
* *done* Execution finished.

Jobs in state 'done' have typically gone through a whole sequence of steps
(called 'testmodules') each of one with its own result. But in addition to those
partial results, a finished job also provides an overall result from the
following list.

* *none* For jobs that have not reached the 'done' state.
* *passed* No critical check failed during the process. It doesn't necessarily 
  mean that all testmodules where successful or that no single assertion failed.
* *failed* At least one assertion considered to be critical was not satisfied at some
  point.
* *incomplete* The job is not longer running but no result was provided. Either
  it was canceled while running either it crashed.

Sometimes, the reason of a failure is not an error in the tested operating system
itself, but an outdated test or a problem in the execution of the job for some
external reason. In those situations, it makes sense to run again a given job from
the beginning once the problem is fixed or the tests have been updated.
This is done by means of 'cloning'. Every job can be superseded by a clone which
is scheduled to run with exactly the same settings than the original job. If the
original job is still not in 'done' state, it's canceled immmediately.
From that point in time, the clone becomes the current version and the original
job is considered outdated (and can be filtered as so in the listing) but its
information and results (if any) are kept for future reference.

Needles
~~~~~~~

One of the main mechanisms for OpenQA to know the state of the virtual machine
is checking the presence of some elements in the machine's `screen'.
This is performed using fuzzy image matching between the screen and the so
called 'needles'. A needle specifies both the elements to search for and a
list of tags used to decide which needles should be used in every moment.

A needle consists of a full screenshot in PNG format and a json file with
the same name (e.g. foo.png and foo.json) containing the associated data, like
which areas inside the full screenshot are relevant or the mentioned list of
tags.

[source,json]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
{
   "area" : [
      {
         "xpos" : INTEGER,
         "ypos" : INTEGER,
         "width" : INTEGER,
         "height" : INTEGER,
         "type" : ( "match" | "ocr" | "exclude" ),
         "match" : INTEGER, // 0-100. similarity percentage
      },
      ...
   ],
   "tags" : [
      STRING, ...
   ]
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Interactive mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several points in time during the execution of a job in which OpenQA
tries to match the screen with the available needles, reacting to the result of
that check. If the job is running in interactive mode it will stop the execution
in that point, freezing the virtual machine and waiting for user input before
proceeding. In that moment, the user can modify the existing needles or can
create a new one using as a starting point either the current screen of the
virtual machine or one of the existing needles. Once the needles are adjusted,
the user can command the job to reload the list of needles and continue with the
execution.

The interactive mode is specially useful when creating needles for a new
operating system or when the look & feel have changed and several needles need
to be adjusted accordingly.


Architecture: OpenQA and os-autoinst
------------------------------------
[id="architecture"]

Although the project as a whole is referred as OpenQA, there are in fact two
different components that are hosted in separate repositories and available as
two different packages, as shown in <<arch_img,the following figure>>.

[[arch_img]]
.OpenQA architecture
image::images/arch.png[OpenQA architecture]

The base of the system is a
standalone application called 'os-autoinst'. In each execution, this application
creates a virtual machine and uses it to run the tests located in a certain
directory, generating a video and a JSON file with detailed results. In its
first stage, os-autoinst reads several configuration variables that have an
influence in the configuration of the machine, the exact behavior of the tests
and the set of needles used in every check.

The rest of the infrastructure is located in the OpenQA package, which main
component is the server that offers two interfaces: a web-based one for human
beings and a JSON based REST-like API. That server -in light gray in
<<arch_img,the figure>>-
relies on a SQLite database to store the list of jobs and all the associated
information.

The OpenQA package also include some smaller components that make
use of the REST-like API for several tasks. The most important one is the
'worker'. An OpenQA worker is a small piece of software that runs a continuous
loop. In each iteration it asks the server for the next job to execute, place
all the related information in a pool directory and calls os-autoinst with the
proper configuration values. Then os-autoinst use the pool directory to read
and write all the relevant information and results. When os-autoinst finish its
execution, the worker reports the result back to the server. In fact, during
the execution of os-autoinst the worker is not idle, since it keeps constantly
querying the server for commands (like `cancel execution' or `go into interactive
mode') that are partially processed by the worker itself and partially forwarded
to the underlying instance of os-autoinst.

Obviously, every instance of OpenQA hosts several workers, every one with its
own pool directory. They can be run manually or managed using systemd. The only
limit is the disk space and the processing power of the host machine.

Access management
-----------------
[id="auth"]

Some actions in OpenQA require special privileges. OpenQA provides
authentication through http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID[openID]. By default,
OpenQA is configured to use the openSUSE openID provider, but it can be very
easily configured to use any other valid provider. Every time a new user logs
into an instance, a new user profile is created. That profile only
contains the openID identity and two flags used for access control:

* *operator* Means that the user is able to manage jobs, performing actions like
  creating new jobs, canceling them, etc.
* *admin* Means that the user is able to manage users (granting or revoking
  operator and admin rights) as well as job templates and other related
  information (see the <<job_templates,the corresponding section>>).

Many of the operations in an OpenQA instance are not performed through the web
interface but using the REST-like API. The most obvious examples are the
workers and the scripts that fetch new versions of the operating system and
schedule the corresponding tests. Those clients must be authorized by an
operator using an
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key[API key] with
an associated shared secret.

For that purpose, users with the operator flag have access in the web interface
to a page that allows them to manage as many API keys as they may need. For every
key, a secret is automatically generated. The user can then configure the
workers or any other client application to use whatever pair of API key and
secret owned by him. Any client to the REST-like API using one of those API keys
will be considered to be acting on behalf of the associated user. So the API key
not only has to be correct and valid (not expired), it also has to belong to a
user with operator rights.

For more insights about authentication, authorization and the technical details
of the OpenQA security model, refer to the
http://lizards.opensuse.org/2014/02/28/about-openqa-and-authentication/[detailed
blog post] about the subject by the OpenQA development team.

Using job templates to automate jobs creation
---------------------------------------------
[id="job_templates"]

The problem
~~~~~~~~~~~

When testing an operating system, specially when doing continuous testing,
there is always a certain combination of jobs, each one with its own
settings, that needs to be run for every revision. Those combinations can be
different for different `flavors' of the same revision, like running a different
set of jobs for each architecture or for the Full and the Lite versions. This
combinational problem can go one step further if openQA is being used for
different kind of tests, like running some simple pre-integration tests
for some snapshots combined with more comprehensive post-integration tests for
release candidates.

This section describes how an instance of OpenQA can be configured using the
options in the admin area to automatically create all the required jobs for each
revision of your operating system that needs to be tested. If you are starting
from scratch, you should probably go through the following order:

. Define machines in 'Machines' menu
. Define products you have in 'Products' menu
. Specify various collections of test you want to run in 'Test suites'
  menu
. Go to the template matrix in 'Job templates' menu and decide what
  combinations does make sense and need to be tested

In openQA we can parametrize a test describing for what product will
run and for what king of machines will be executed. For example, a
test like KDE can be run for any product that have KDE installed, and
can be tested in x86-64 and i586 machines. If we write this as a
triples, we can create a list like this to characterize KDE tests:

  (Product,             Test Suite, Machine)
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        64bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        Laptop-64bit)
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        USBBoot-64bit)
  (openSUSE-DVD-i586,   KDE,        32bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-i586,   KDE,        Laptop-32bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        USBBoot-32bit)
  (openSUSE-DVD-i586,   KDE,        64bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-i586,   KDE,        Laptop-64bit) 
  (openSUSE-DVD-x86_64, KDE,        USBBoot-64bit)

For every triplet, we need to configure a different instance of
os-autoinst with a different set of parameters.

Products
~~~~~~~~

A product in openQA is a simple description without any concrete
meaning. Basically consist of a name and a set of variables that
define or characterize this product in os-autoinst.

For example, the product openSUSE-DVD-x86_64 require the variables
+ISO_MAXSIZE+ and +DVD+ to be set up.

The list of variables as dynamic and are consumed by the tests, that
is the one that provide a semantic to this variable. Some usual
variables are:

* +ISO_MAXSIZE+ contains the maximum size of the product. There is a
  test that check that the current size of the product is less or
  equal than this variable.
* +DVD+ if is set to 1, this indicate that the medium is a DVD.
* +LIVECD+ if is set to 1, this indicate that the medium is a live
  image (can be a CD or USB)
* +GNOME+ this variable, is is set to 1, will indicate that is a GNOME
  only distribution.
* +PROMO+ mark the promotional product.
* +RESCUECD+ if set to 1 for rescue CD images.


Test Suites
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the form where we define the different tests that we created
for openQA. A test consist of a name, a priority (used in the
scheduler to choose the next job) and a set of variables that are used
inside this particular test.

Again, the list of variables is not complete, because are
test-dependent, but some of the usual are:

* +BTRFS+ if set, the file system will be BtrFS.
* +DESKTOP+ possible values are 'kde' 'gnome' 'lxde' 'xfce' or
  'texmode'. Used to indicate the desktop selected by the user during
  the test.
* +DOCRUN+ used for document tests.
* +DUALBOOT+ dual boot testing, need HDD_1 and HDDVERSION.
* +ENCRYPT+ encrypt the home directory via YaST.
* +HDDMODEL+ variable to set the HDD hardware model.
* +HDDSIZEGB+ hard disk size in GB. Used together with BtrFS variable.
* +HDDVERSION+ together with HDD_1 to set the operating system
  previously installed in the hard disk.
* +HDD_1+ path for the pre-created hard disk.
* +INSTALLONLY+ only basic installation.
* +INSTLANG+ installation language. Actually used only in document
  tests.
* +LIVETEST+ the test is on live medium, do not install the distribution.
* +LVM+ select LVM volume manager.
* +NICEVIDEO+ used for test with better video quality (show room).
* +NOAUTOLOGIN+ unmark autologin in YaST
* +NUMDISKS+ total number of disks in QEMU.
* +QEMUVGA+ parameter to declare the video hardware configuration in QEMU.
* +RAIDLEVEL+ RAID configuration variable
* +REBOOTAFTERINSTALL+ if set to 1, will reboot after the installation.
* +SCREENSHOTINTERVAL+ used with NICEVIDEO to improve the video quality.
* +SPLITUSR+ a YaST configuration option.
* +TOGGLEHOME+ a YaST configuration option.
* +UPGRADE+ upgrade testing, need HDD_1 and HDDVERSION.
* +VIDEOMODE+ if the value is 'text', the installation will be done in
  text mode.

Machines
~~~~~~~~

You need to have at least one machine set up to be able to run any
tests. Those machine represents virtual machine types that you want to
test. To make tests actually happen, you have to have a 'openQA
worker' connected that can fullfill those specifications.

* *Name.* User defined string only needed for operator to identify the machine
configuration.

* *Backend.* What backend should be used for this machine. Recommended value is
+qemu+ as it is the most tested one, but other options (like +kvm2usb+ or +vbox+)
are also possible.

* *Variables* Variables represent a way how to influence backend behaviour.
Few important examples:
** +QEMUCPU+ can be 'qemu32' or 'qemu64' and specifies architecture of
   virtual CPU.
** +QEMUCPUS+ is an integer that specifies number of cores you wish for.
** +LAPTOP+ if set to 1, QEMU will create a laptop profile.
** +USBBOOT+ when set to 1, the image will be loaded through an
   emulated USB stick.
** +SMP+ enables smp when set to 1, disables when set to 0.

Testing openSUSE
----------------

Easiest way to start using openQA is to start testing openSUSE as we have
everything setup and prepared to ease the initial deployment. If you want to
play deeper, you can configure whole openQA manually from scratch, but this
document should help you to get started faster.

Getting tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you need to get actual tests. You can get openSUSE tests and needles (the
expected results) from 
https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-needles-opensuse[GitHub]. It belongs
to the +/var/lib/os-autoinst/tests+ directory. To make it easier, you can just
run

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/usr/lib/os-autoinst/tools/fetchneedles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which will download the tests to the correct location and will set correct
rights as well.

Getting openQA configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get everything configured to actually run the tests, there is a plenty of
options to set in admin interface. If you plan to tes openSUSE Factory, using
tests mentioned in previous section, easiest way to get started is the
following command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/var/lib/os-autoinst/tests/opensuse/templates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will load some default settings that were used at some point of time in
openSUSE production openQA. Therefor those should work reasonably well with
openSUSE tests and needles.

Adding new iso to test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start testing new ISO put it in +/var/lib/openqa/factory/iso+ and call
following commands:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Run the first test
/usr/share/openqa/script/client isos post \
         ISO=openSUSE-Factory-NET-x86_64-Build0053-Media.iso \
         DISTRI=opensuse \
         VERSION=Factory \
         FLAVOR=NET \
         ARCH=x86_64 \
         BUILD=0053
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your openQA is not running on port 80 on 'localhost', you can add option
+--host=http://otherhost:9526+ to specify different port or host.

WARNING: Using only iso name in 'client' command and saving it in
+/var/lib/openqa/factory/iso+ is recommended as is using Factory iso. ISOs are
not uploaded from the path that you would specify.
