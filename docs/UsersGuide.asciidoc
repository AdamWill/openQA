== Introduction

This document provides additional information for use of the web interface or
the REST API as well as administration information.
For administrators it is recommend to have read the
link:Installing.asciidoc[installation guide] first to understand the structure
of components as well as the configuration of an installed instance.

== Use of the web interface

In general the web UI should be intuitive or self-explanatory. Look out for the
little blue help icons and click them for detailed help on specific sections.

Some pages use queries to select what should be shown. The query parameters are
generated on clickable links, for example starting from the index page or the
group overview page clicking on single builds. On the query pages there can be
UI elements to control the parameters, for example to look for more older
builds or only show failed jobs or other settings. Additionally, the query
parameters can be tweaked by hand if you want to provide a link to specific
views.


=== /tests/overview - Customizable test overview page

The overview page is configurable by the filter box. Also, some additional
query parameters can be provided which can be considered advanced or
experimental. For example specifying no build will resolve the latest build
which matches the other parameters specified. Specifying no group will show
all jobs from all matching job groups. Also specifying multiple groups works,
see <<overview_multiple_groups,the following example>>.

[[overview_multiple_groups]]

== Use of the REST API

openQA includes a _client_ script which - depending on the distribution - is
packaged independantly if you just want to interface with an existing openQA
instance without needing to install the full package. Call
`<openqa-folder>/script/client --help` for help (openSUSE: `openqa-client
--help`).

== Where to now?

For test developers it is recommended to continue with the
link:WritingTests.asciidoc[Test Developer Guide].
