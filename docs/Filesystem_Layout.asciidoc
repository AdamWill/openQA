Filesystem Layout
=================

The openQA web interface can be started via +MOJO_REVERSE_PROXY=1 morbo script/openqa+ in
development mode.

+/var/lib/openqa/+ must be owned by root and contain several sub
directories owned by the user that runs the workers (default 'geekotest'):

* +backlog+
* +cache+ (cache directory, it need owned by the user who runs openqa)
* +factory/iso+
* +perl/+ (subdirectory 'autoinst' must link to +/usr/lib/os-autoinst+)
* +pool/1+ (add more for each worker)
* +testresults+
* +tools+ (symlink to +/usr/share/openqa/tools/+)

+/var/lib/openqa/db+ contains the sqlite database and must be owned by
the user that runs the web interface ('geekotest'). To initially create this
database, you need to run +tools/initdb+.
