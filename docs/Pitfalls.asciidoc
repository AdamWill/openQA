openQA pitfalls

Needle editing
==============

- if a new needle is created based on a failed test, the new needle
  will not be listed in old tests.
- if an existing needle is updated with a new image or different
  areas, the old test will display the new needle which might be
  confusing
- if a needle is deleted, old tests may display an error when viewing
  them in the web UI.

IPv6
====

www.opensuse.org's openid provider may have trouble with IPv6. openQA shows a message like this:

  no_identity_server: Could not determine ID provider from URL.

To avoid that switch off IPv6 or add a special route that prevents the system
from trying to use IPv6 with www.opensuse.org:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ip -6 r a to unreachable 2600:806:310::100/128
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
