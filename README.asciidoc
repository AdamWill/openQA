openQA is testing framework that allows you to test GUI applications on one
hand and bootloader and kernel on the other. In both cases, it is difficult to
script test and verify the output. Output can be popup window or it can be
error in early boot even before init is executed.

Therefor openQA runs virtual machines and closely monitors their state and
runs tests on them.

Testing framework can be divided in two parts. One that is hosted in this
repository is web frontend and management logic (test scheduling, management,
high-level API, ...)

The other part that you need to run openQA is OS-autoinst test engine that is
hosted in separate https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst[repository].

Getting started
---------------

To get started, we have a documentation about how you can
link:docs/Installation.asciidoc[install openQA] and how to
link:docs/openSUSE_Tests.asciidoc[run openSUSE tests there].
If you are interested in more advance features, we have documentation regarding
link:docs/Advanced_configuration.asciidoc[advanced setups] like git integration
or running behind the proxy. All the settings that could influence the testing
are also link:/docs/Settings.asciidoc[documented].

If you run into troubles, check our
link:docs/Troubleshooting.asciidoc[troubleshooting guide].

If you are interested in development, check
link:docs/Development.asciidoc[developers documentation], write your code and
